## Variables
1. Used to store data and can be referenced later
2. similar to variables in general programming languages like python, java, C#

## How variables work
**Syntax:**

variable_name=what_you_are_refrencing  
i.e. whenever the variable is called, it will answer to whatever you referenced

In order to reference a variable, use the $ sign

e.g.

    echo "my name is $name. Thanks"
